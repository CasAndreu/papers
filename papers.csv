   inhibits political change in authoritarian regimes. This article
   challenges both the negative political effects of aid and the similarity
   of aid to other resources. It develops a model incorporating changing
   donor preferences and the heterogeneity of foreign aid. Consistent with
   the model's predictions, an empirical test for the period 1973-2010
   shows that, on average, the negative relationship between aid and the
   likelihood of democratic change is confined to the ColdWar period.
   However, in the post-Cold War period, nondemocratic recipients of
   particular strategic importance can still use aid to thwart change. The
   relationship between oil revenue and democratic change does not follow
   the same pattern over time or across recipients. This supports the
   conclusion that aid has different properties than other, fungible,
   resources.}","{10.1017/S0020818315000296}","{0020-8183}","{1531-5088}","{ISI:000369585700001}"

   over territory is especially common and destructive, there is less
   agreement over what it is about territory that leads to these outcomes.
   Understanding the role of territory in international conflict requires
   complementing realist and materialist understandings of the value of
   territory with one grounded in the constructivist theories that dominate
   studies of nationalism and geography. Doing so recognizes that homeland
   territoriality, because it raises the value of a specific territory and
   provides an imperative to establish sovereignty over it, plays a
   distinctive role in driving international conflict. This article
   presents a systematic, replicable operationalization of the homeland
   status of territory that, because it is consistent with constructivist
   theories of nationalism, can be used to integrate constructivist
   understandings of the role of territory into quantitative studies of
   territorial conflict. This measure is then used to test the implication
   that the loss of subjectively defined homeland territory increases the
   likelihood of international conflict relative to the loss of nonhomeland
   territory. The findings that dividing homelands is especially likely to
   lead to conflict are corroborated by a second novel measure of the
   homeland status of territory that is based on the identification of
   co-ethnics in a territory before the border was drawn.}","{10.1017/S0020818315000193}","{0020-8183}","{1531-5088}","{ISI:000369585700002}"

   recipient countries, some foreign aid donors outsource the delivery of
   aid to nonstate development actors. Other donor governments continue to
   support state management of aid, seeking to strengthen recipient states.
   These cross-donor differences can be attributed in large measure to
   different national orientations about the appropriate role of the state
   in public service delivery. Countries that place a high premium on
   market efficiency (for example, the United States, United Kingdom,
   Sweden) will outsource aid delivery in poorly governed recipient
   countries to improve the likelihood that aid reaches the intended
   beneficiaries of services. In contrast, states whose political economies
   emphasize a strong state in service provision (for example, France,
   Germany, Japan) continue to support state provision. This argument is
   borne out by a variety of tests, including statistical analysis of

   and private policy tools. Yet there is a profound mismatch between the
   depth, variety, and importance of covert activity and what scholars of
   International Relations (IR) know about it. This article addresses this
   gap by analyzing how adversaries struggle for influence within the
   covert sphere, why they often retreat to it, and when they abandon it.
   It focuses on secrecy among adversaries intervening in local conflicts
   and develops a theory about secrecy's utility as a device for creating
   sustainable limits in war. Drawing on insights about secrecy and
   face-work from the sociologist Erving Goffman, I show that major powers
   individually and collectively conceal evidence of foreign involvement
   when the danger of unintended conflict escalation is acute. Doing so
   creates a kind of ``backstage{''} in which adversaries can exceed limits
   on war without stimulating hard-to-resist pressure to escalate further.
   An important payoff of the theory is making sense of puzzling cases of
   forbearance: even though adversaries often know about their opponent's
   covert activity, they often abstain from publicizing it. Such ``tacit
   collusion{''} arises when both sides seek to manage escalation risks
   even as they compete for power and refuse to capitulate. The article
   evaluates the theory via several nested cases of external intervention
   in the Korean War. Drawing on newly available materials documenting the
   covert air war between secretly deployed Soviet pilots and Western
   forces, the cases show how adversaries can successfully limit war by
   concealing activity from outside audiences. Beyond highlighting the
   promise in studying the covert realm in world politics, the article has
   important implications for scholarship on coercive bargaining,

   for being inconsistent (the traditional audience cost), and for
   threatening to use force in the first place (a belligerence cost). We
   employ an experiment that disentangles these two rationales, and turn to
   a series of dispositional characteristics from political psychology to
   bring the audience into audience cost theory. Our results suggest that
   traditional audience cost experiments may overestimate how much people

   one state fails to undertake an otherwise productive investment due to
   the increased ability it would give another state to extract political
   concessions. Focusing on the World Trade Organization (WTO), I

   existing empirical work on this subject by exploring the potential
   mechanisms through which a democratic transition may prompt a government
   to alter provision of basic services to its citizens. In an environment
   of weak state capacity, in which it is difficult for voters to attribute
   outcomes to executive actions, we suggest that electoral competition is
   most likely to lead to changes in policies where executive action is
   verifiable. Considering the context of African primary education as an
   example, we suggest that electoral competition will therefore give
   governments an incentive to abolish school fees, but it will have less
   effect on the provision of school inputs, precisely because executive
   actions on these issues are more difficult to monitor. We evaluate this
   claim by approaching it in three different ways, using cross-national as
   well as individual-level data, including an original data set on primary
   school fee abolitions. First we show that in Africa, democracies have
   higher rates of school attendance than nondemocracies. Moreover,
   evidence suggests that this is primarily due to the fact that
   democracies are more likely to abolish school fees, not to the fact that
   they provide more inputs. We then estimate the likelihood that a
   government will abolish school fees subsequent to an election, taking
   account of endogeneity concerns involving election timing. Finally, we
   use survey data from Kenya to provide evidence suggesting that citizens
   condition their voting intentions on an outcome that a politician can
   control directly, in this case abolishing school fees, but not on
   outcomes over which politicians have much more indirect influence, such
   as local school quality.}","{10.1017/S0022381613001254}","{0022-3816}","{1468-2508}","{ISI:000332516700022}"

   the Cold War consensus. Its usual periodization, according to which it
   came together in the late 1940s and persisted until the late 1960s when
   it unraveled amidst the trauma of the Vietnam War, fits well with a
   common theory of change in ideas and discourse. That theory expects
   stasis until a substantial unexpected failure (in this domain, military
   defeat) discredits dominant ideas and unsettles dominant coalitions.
   However, systematic data reveal the standard history of this important

   before the Vietnam War's Americanization in 1965. To make sense of this

   narratives that underpin and structure debate over national security.
   Rooted in the dynamics of public narrative and the domestic politics of
   the battlefield, the theory argues that military failure impedes change
   in the narrative in whose terms government officials had legitimated the
   mission, whereas victory creates the opportunity for departures from the
   dominant narrative. Process-tracing reveals causal dynamics consistent

   Cold War globalism, instead facilitated the Cold War narrative's rise to
   dominance (or consensus); and the triumph of the Cuban Missile Crisis
   made possible that dominant narrative's breakdown before the upheaval of

   other means in the absence of the drive. Second, estimating the causal
   effect of registration on turnout is difficult because the act of
   selection signals political interest and engagement that is correlated
   with turnout. This article utilizes field experiments to answer these
   two questions and the second question of the type of person mobilized by
   registration drives. 1 Across six cities, 620 streets were randomly

   political centralization undermines economic performance by removing a
   functioning electoral mechanism that makes leaders responsive to a wide
   range of economic concerns. In uncompetitive regions, however,
   centralization encourages economic improvement by reducing leaders'
   reliance on narrow interests and making previously unassailable local
   leaders answerable to central political bosses. I test competing
   hypotheses about the economic effects of political centralization using
   a set of Russian regional reforms that removed the direct election of
   governors in favor of a system of centralized appointments. The data
   show that, on a number of different dimensions, economic performance

   that economic and political sanctions are a successful tool of
   nonproliferation policy, but that selection effects have rendered this
   success largely hidden. Since the late 1970s-when the United States made
   the threat of sanctions credible through congressional legislation and
   began regularly employing sanctions against proliferating
   states-sanctions have been ineffective in halting ongoing nuclear
   weapons programs, but they have succeeded in deterring states from
   starting nuclear weapons programs in the first place and have thus
   contributed to a decline in the rate of nuclear pursuit. The logic of
   the argument is simple: rational leaders assess the risk of sanctions
   before initiating a nuclear weapons program, which produces a selection
   effect whereby states highly vulnerable to sanctions are deterred from
   starting nuclear weapons programs in the first place, so long as the
   threat is credible. Vulnerability is a function of a state's level of
   economic and security dependence on the United States-states with
   greater dependence have more to lose from US sanctions and are more
   likely to be sensitive to US-sponsored norms. The end result of this
   selection effect is that since the late 1970s, only insulated,
   inward-looking regimes have pursued nuclear weapons and become the
   target of imposed sanctions, thus rendering the observed success rate of
   nonproliferation sanctions low. I find support for the argument based on
   statistical analysis of a global sample of countries from 1950 to 2000,
   an original data set of US nonproliferation sanctions episodes, and

   political scientists, few studies have investigated the ability of
   different firms to reap gains from policy change. Reforms indeed create
   winners and losers, but there is scant evidence on specifically which
   firms benefit and which firms lose out. We propose that the benefits
   from liberalizing reform accrue mostly to firms that are not vulnerable
   to extortion by the state and that have past experience with lobbying
   through a business association. This theory goes against the common
   intuition that liberalization reduces the importance of the state in the
   distribution of gains from economic activity. To test the theory, we
   examine how India's national electricity reform in 2003 changed the
   quality of power supply for 1,094 manufacturing firms between 2002 and
   2005. We find that liberalization produced highly skewed benefits and
   identify the politically salient characteristics that drive firm-level
   distributional inequality.}","{10.1017/S0022381614000061}","{0022-3816}","{1468-2508}","{ISI:000338104000031}"

   difficult questions in the empirical study of institutions and
   leadership. We argue that provided there is an indicator for the overall
   individual influence among members of the political elite and there is
   sufficient variability among individuals taking the same office, being
   promoted and demoted into different offices over time, we can separate
   latent individual and institutional components of influence at an
   aggregate, regime level. Our latent variable model thus provides a new
   tool to measure the degree of regime deinstitutionalization. Using
   expert surveys that assess the ranking of the top political actors in
   Russia from 1994 to 2011 and restricting personal effects to those that
   are constant over time, we find that on average office dominates
   individual by the order of two. We discuss regime deinstitutionalization

   analyzing Ukraine, and account for patronage networks.}","{10.1017/S0022381614000280}","{0022-3816}","{1468-2508}","{ISI:000338104000032}"

   individuals -not states-are the primary transgressors. If individuals
   behave as some states do, publicly embracing international norms only
   because they expect a financial or reputational benefit from doing so,
   then the campaigns have not fully succeeded. But when do individuals
   engage in real behavior change, and when do they simply change the
   public image they present to the international community? To begin to
   address this question, I employ a randomized field experiment to
   evaluate individuals' willingness to make claims that differ from their
   true normative commitments. I conducted the experiment in the context of
   an original 2008 opinion survey about female genital mutilation and

   background characteristics of more than 2,500 heads of state from 1875

   institutional waves that focuses on the effects of systemic
   transformations. It argues that abrupt shifts in the distribution of
   power among leading states create unique and powerful incentives for
   sweeping domestic reforms. A variety of statistical tests reveals strong
   support for the idea that shifts in hegemonic power have shaped waves of
   democracy, fascism, and communism in the twentieth century, independent
   of domestic factors or horizontal diffusion. These ``hegemonic
   shocks{''} produce windows of opportunity for external regime
   imposition, enable rising powers to rapidly expand networks of trade and
   patronage, and inspire imitators by credibly revealing hidden
   information about relative regime effectiveness to foreign audiences. I
   outline these mechanisms of coercion, influence, and emulation that
   connect shocks to waves, empirically test their relationship, and
   illustrate the theory with two case studies the wave of democratic
   transitions after World War I, and the fascist wave of the late interwar
   period. In sum, democracy in the twentieth century cannot be fully
